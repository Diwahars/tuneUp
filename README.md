Music recommender system

Work started as part of Coursework of Information Retrieval Semester I 2015-2016

## Work Plan
* We could call a C++/ Rust api from Python to make things faster. Though I am not sure as to how much time can we devote, given the obscene amount of upcoming tests.
* We will use item based collaborative filtering, since that works well with items like music, movies.
* [Dataset:](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/index.html)
Note that there are a couple of datasets there.
